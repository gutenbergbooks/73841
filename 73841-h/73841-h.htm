  <h2 class='c003'>EXPERIMENTAL GLASS BLOWING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Boys, glass tubes are made in the sizes shown in Fig. 2, and
in larger sizes. You will use sizes 2, 4, and 6 in the following
<b>experiments</b>.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 1. Fun bending glass.</h3>

<div  class='figright id001'>
<img src='images/fig_002.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 2<br>  <br>  SIZES OF GLASS TUBING</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hold a piece of No. 2,
with both hands, in the
flame of the alcohol lamp,
and turn it constantly
(Fig. 3). Do you find that
when the glass becomes nearly red hot, it becomes soft and
bends easily?</p>

<div  class='figleft id001'>
<img src='images/fig_003.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 3<br>  <br>  HEATING GLASS TO SOFTEN IT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Take the tube out of
the flame, bend it into
any shape you wish
(Fig. 4), and allow it to
cool. Do you find that
the glass hardens when
it cools and retains the
bent shape?</p>

<p class='c007'>Heat the tube near
the first bend, turn it
constantly, take it out
of the flame, and make
another bend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat this and make
all kinds of fantastic shapes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Place all hot glass on the cooling blocks, not on the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>Glass is used in many, many ways by the human race; for
example, to make bottles, tumblers, window glass, and so on, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>all of these uses depend
upon the facts
which you have just illustrated,
namely, that
glass becomes soft
when heated and hard
when cooled again.</p>

<p>FIG. 4<br>  <br>  BENDING GLASS</p>
</div>
</div>

<h4 class='c008'>THE LAMP</h4>

<p class='c006'>The wick should be
cut straight across and
should project above
the wick holder about
⅛ inch (Fig. 5), or a
little more if you
require more heat. Burn wood alcohol or grain alcohol, because
they give flames without soot or smoke. Fill the lamp to
within a ½ inch of the top only; it will burn one hour. The
hottest part of the flame is not down close to the wick, as most
beginners suppose, but up just beneath the tip.</p>

<div  class='figleft id001'>
<img src='images/fig_005.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 5<br>  <br>  THE LAMP</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Buy your alcohol at a drug store in quantities of one pint or
more. When you are through experimenting for the day pour
the alcohol from the lamp back into the pint bottle and cork
the bottle tightly. Alcohol
left in the lamp gradually
evaporates and is
lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not let the lamp
stand with alcohol in it
for any considerable time—overnight
for example—because fuel alcohol contains water
and when it evaporates from the wick, the alcohol evaporates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>first and leaves the water in the wick. Then when you
try to light the wick again, you will find that you cannot
do so, because, of course, water does not burn. If this happens
to you, take the wick out, dry it, and start the lamp
again.</p>

<div  class='figright id001'>
<img src='images/fig_006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 6<br>  <br>  MAKING A SCRATCH</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is perfectly safe to use kerosene in the lamp, but it gives
a very smoky flame
which deposits soot on
the glass and fills the
air with soot particles.
Your mother will object
very strenuously
to this because the
soot particles settle
and blacken everything.
Burn alcohol
only, at least in the
house.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 2. To cut glass tubing.</h3>

<div  class='figleft id001'>
<img src='images/fig_007.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 7<br>  <br>  BREAKING THE TUBE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Cut off a six-inch
length of No. 2 as follows:
Lay the tube flat on the table, mark the six-inch length
and draw the file across the tube at this point, pressing hard
enough to make a good
scratch (Fig. 6). Grasp
the tube with both
hands near the scratch,
as in Fig. 7, pull apart
and bend slightly. Do
you find that the tube breaks across easily?</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat this with No. 4 and No. 6 tubes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>Experiment 3. To make the edges smooth.</h3>
</div>

<div  class='figright id001'>
<img src='images/fig_008.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 8<br>  <br>  MAKING THE EDGES SMOOTH</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hold one end of the six-inch piece of No. 2 in the tip of the
flame (Fig. 8), and turn
constantly until it is just
red hot. Take it out and
let it cool on the blocks.
Do you find that the edges
are smooth?</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat with the other
end.</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat with both ends of
the six-inch piece of No. 4.</p>

<p class='c007'>If thick glass is heated
quickly it may crack, because
the hot exterior expands
more quickly than
the cooler interior and
produces internal strains.</p>

<div  class='figleft id001'>
<img src='images/fig_009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 9<br>  <br>  THE BLOWPIPE FLAME</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The No. 6 tube is comparatively
thick and
should be heated <b>gradually</b>
as follows: Hold
the end in the flame for
about 1 second, then
withdraw it for about 1
second; hold it in the
flame again for 1 second,
and withdraw it for 1
second. Repeat this eight
or ten times, then hold
and turn it in the flame
until red hot.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Smooth both ends of the No. 6 piece in this way.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 4. Practice with the blowpipe.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Hold the small end of the blowpipe just inside the flame at one
edge, about ⅛ inch above the wick (Fig. 9), and blow air
through the flame parallel to the top of the wick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Keep your mouth closed on the blowpipe, <b>breathe through
your nose</b>, and <b>practice keeping a steady stream of air going for
a long time</b>. You will be able to do this with a little practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you observe that the blowpipe flame is pointed, also that it
is made up of a pointed cone inside and a lighter-colored cone
outside? The hottest part of the flame is inside the outer cone
just beyond the point of the inner cone.</p>

<div  class='figright id001'>
<img src='images/fig_010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 10<br>  <br>  CLOSING ONE END OF A TUBE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The blowpipe flame is
hotter than the lamp
flame because the heat of
the burning alcohol is
concentrated at one
point by means of the air
blast, and because the
alcohol is more completely
burned by the
extra air.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 5. To close the end of a small tube.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Hold one end of a
piece of No. 2 tube in the
blowpipe flame (Fig. 10),
turn it slowly, and heat until the end closes. Does it close nicely?</p>

<p class='c007'>Close one end of a piece of No. 4 in the same way.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can close No. 6 tubing in this way, but it leaves a large
lump of glass which may crack on cooling or on reheating. You
will practice closing No. 6 tubing later.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h4 class='c008'>The “why” of it</h4>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The glass becomes soft when heated because it becomes almost
a liquid, and if it is heated sufficiently it becomes entirely
a liquid. In this respect it acts very much as pitch, rosin, and
wax act when heated by the sun or by a fire.</p>

<div  class='figleft id001'>
<img src='images/fig_011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 11<br>  <br>  MAKING A GLASS BUBBLE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The end of a glass tube becomes smooth, or closes entirely,
when heated, for the following reason: The surface of any
liquid tries to take the
smallest possible area
(this is explained in detail
under “Surface Tension”
in the Gilbert book
on “Experimental Mechanics”),
for example, a
small particle of water
takes the shape of a drop,
a sphere, and the surface
of a sphere has the least
area for a given amount
of water. Now when the
end of the glass tube is
heated it becomes a liquid,
and the surface of this liquid contracts the glass into a smooth
rounded surface of least area. If the tube is heated still more,
the surface contracts still more and closes the end.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 6. Fun blowing glass bubbles.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Smooth one end of a piece of No. 2 tube and allow it to
cool. Close the other end in the blowpipe flame, turn it slowly,
and heat until it is very hot. Take the tube out of the flame,
put the smooth end into your mouth quickly, and blow as hard
as you can (Fig. 11). Do you get a fine big glass bubble which
bursts with a pop?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>If you get only a small bulb at the first trial, heat the end,
and try again. Do you find that the bulb shrinks when heated
but blows out again readily?</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 12<br>  <br>  BLOWING A BULB</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When you get a big bubble, place the bubble end
of the tube on a cooling
block and break all
the thin glass away from
the tube by striking it
with the file or blowpipe.
Then close the end and
blow another bubble.</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat until you can
blow bubbles easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat with a piece of
No. 4 tube.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>BUBBLE COLORS</h4>

<p>FIG. 13<br>  <br>  A WATER BALLOON</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Do you find that the
thin glass of the bubbles
shows colors, especially in
sunlight, just as soap bubbles do?
You boys who have had the Gilbert
set on “Light Experiments” will know
that these colors are due to “interference.”
The colors produced by a thin film of
oil on water are also produced by “interference.”</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 7. To make water balloons.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Close one end of the No. 2 tube in the
blowpipe flame again and while it is still
hot blow carefully into the open end until
you have a bulb about ½ inch in
diameter (Fig. 12). Now let it cool.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Make a scratch with the file about ¼ inch
from the bulb, break the tube at this
point (Fig. 13), and smooth the rough
edge.</p>

<p>FIG. 14<br>  <br>  THE BALLOON SINKS AND RISES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Put the bulb in a tumbler of water.
Does it float? If not, make another balloon
with a larger bulb.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 8. Magic.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Find a large bottle made of clear glass,
the neck of which will fit your solid rubber
stopper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fill the bottle with water <b>to overflowing</b>,
insert the balloon, and then the
stopper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now press down hard on the stopper.
Does the balloon sink in a most magical
manner (Fig. 14)?</p>

<p class='c007'>Release the stopper. Does the balloon
rise in an equally magical manner?</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 9. Balloon races.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Make another water balloon. Put the two
balloons together in the bottle filled to overflowing
with water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Insert the stopper and press down hard.
Do the balloons sink (Fig. 15), and does one
sink more quickly than the other?</p>

<p class='c007'>Release the stopper. Do the balloons rise,
and does one rise more quickly than the
other?</p>

<p class='c007'>The most buoyant balloon sinks last and
rises first.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 16<br>  <br>  DRAWING A THIN TUBE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You boys who have the Gilbert set on “Hydraulic and Pneumatic
Engineering” will know the “why” of the last three experiments.
Any body floats in water if it is lighter than an
equal volume of water, and it sinks if it is heavier than an equal
volume of water. Water is practically incompressible but air
is very compressible: thus
when you press down on
the stopper, you force water
into the balloon and compress
the air in it; when
you release the stopper, the
compressed air in the balloon
expands and drives the
water out. When the
weight of the balloon and
the weight of the water in
it are together greater than
the weight of water displaced
by the balloon, the
balloon sinks; when they are less, it rises.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 10. Fun with thin tubes.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Hold a piece of No. 2 tubing in the lamp flame and turn it
constantly. When it is red hot and soft, <b>take it out of the
flame</b> and pull your hands apart until the tube is stretched ten
or twelve inches (Fig. 16). Is the tube in the shape shown in
Fig. 17?</p>

<p class='c007'>Allow the tube to cool, break the large ends away from the
thin tube, place one end of the thin tube in a glass of water, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>blow into the other end to make air bubbles in the water

<p class='c007'>The “why” of this is explained in Gilbert’s
“Experimental Mechanics” under “Capillarity.”</p>

<h4 class='c008'>WHAT IS GLASS?</h4>

<p class='c006'>Common glass is made from three substances
with which you are all more or less
familiar; namely, sand, sodium carbonate
(washing soda), and lime.</p>

<p class='c007'>If sand and soda or potash are mixed and
heated to a high temperature, they melt together
and produce a glass which dissolves in
water. This is known as “water glass” and it is used in many
ways: to preserve eggs, to cement fire bricks, to make fireproof
cement, and so on. If, however, lime is added and the mixture
is heated to a high temperature, a glass is produced which is not
soluble in water. This is the glass you know.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three most common kinds of glass are: Venetian glass,
made from sand, soda, and lime; Bohemian glass, from sand,
potash, and lime; and crystal or flint glass, from sand, potash,
and lead oxide.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h4 class='c008'>HOW ARE THINGS MADE OF GLASS?</h4>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The glass mixture is heated to a high temperature in fire clay
pots or tanks in large ovens. The surface is skimmed from time
to time and the heating is continued until all air bubbles have
escaped from the mixture, usually about three days.</p>

<p class='c007'>The glass is now quite fluid and it is allowed to cool somewhat
until it is viscous; then the objects are made by blowing,
pressing, or rolling, as described below.</p>

<p class='c007'>The finished articles are finally “annealed,” that is, they are
placed while still hot in a second hot oven, which is then sealed
and allowed to cool slowly, for four or five days or for as many
weeks, according to the kind of glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a glass object cools quickly, it cools more rapidly on the
surface than in the interior. This produces a condition of strain
in the glass and the object may drop to pieces when jarred or
scratched. This condition of strain is avoided by allowing the
objects to cool very slowly, that is, by annealing.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>WINDOW GLASS</h4>

<p class='c006'>Window glass is blown in exactly the same way as you have
blown glass balloons; the process is illustrated in Fig. 1.</p>

<p class='c007'>The glass mixture is heated for about three days in fire clay
pots and is allowed to cool until it is viscous. The glass blower
then attaches a lump of the viscous glass to the end of a straight
iron blowpipe about five feet long and blows a bulb. He then
reheats the glass and blows a larger pear-shaped bulb and in
doing so rests the glass on a pear-shaped mold of charred wood
(see center of Fig. 1). He again reheats the glass, holds the pear-shaped
bulb over a pit, and blows a long cylinder (see left of Fig. 1).</p>

<p class='c007'>The ends of the cylinder are now cut off and the edges are
smeared with molten glass to prevent splitting (see right,
Fig. 21). The cylinder is next cut lengthwise with a diamond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>(center, Fig. 21), and is placed in a second hot oven, where it is
ironed out flat (Fig. 22).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The glass tubes with which you do the experiments in this book
are made in the same way as window glass up to the stage of
blowing the cylinder; then the blower’s helper attaches an iron
rod to the opposite end of the cylinder (see right of Fig. 1), and
the blower and helper walk backward away from each other to
pull the cylinder into a tube. Of course, they use a small amount
of glass to make small tubes, and larger amounts for large tubes.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>MOLDED GLASS</h4>

<p class='c006'>Many articles of glass are made by blowing the glass in molds.
Bottles are made in this way (Fig. 23), and large machines
are now in use which mold many bottles at one time in this
way.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>PRESSED GLASS</h4>

<p class='c006'>Many articles are made by pressing glass into molds, that is,
the molten glass is poured into molds and is pressed against the
sides of the mold by means of a plunger. Imitation cut glass
is pressed in this way.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>PLATE GLASS</h4>

<p class='c006'>The large sheets of plate glass used in store windows are not
blown, but rolled. The molten glass is poured from the fire
clay pots upon a cast-iron table and is rolled flat by means of
a large iron roller (Fig. 24). The glass is then in the shape of
plate glass, but is rough on both sides. It is annealed for a number
of days and then is ground smooth on both sides, first with
coarse emery, then with finer and finer emery, and is finally
polished with rouge. The result is the beautifully polished
plate glass we see in large windows.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>OPTICAL GLASS</h4>

<p class='c006'>The United States and Great Britain made great strides in
the manufacture of optical glass during the war and there are
now many kinds on the market. They are used in making the
lenses, prisms, and mirrors for optical instruments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Optical glass is made in much the same way as ordinary glass,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>but great care is taken: first, to see that the materials are pure;
second, to stir the glass constantly, as it cools from the molten
to the viscous state, to make it as uniform as possible; and third,
to cool it very slowly in the annealing process, to avoid strains.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>An entirely new glass has been placed on the market in quantity
in recent years. It is made by melting very pure quartz sand
at a temperature of 3000° F. and cooling it fairly rapidly. It
has the very valuable property of expanding
and contracting very, very
slightly when heated and cooled. Thus
there is practically no internal strain set
up when it is heated or cooled quickly
and it does not break. It can be heated
red hot, for example, and then plunged
into cold water without breaking. It is
probable that this glass will be in universal
use in a very few years.</p>

you press the stopper in, you compress the
air in the submarine and force water in until
the submarine weighs more than an equal
volume of water and it sinks. When you
release the pressure on the stopper, the compressed
air forces the water out until the submarine becomes
lighter than an equal volume of water and it rises. The water

mark on it feet and inches, beginning at the bottom end, and
your leveling rod is complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now to find the difference in level of two points 100 feet

level between the two points, ask a friend to hold the rod on the
ground and upright, at the first point, sight along the water
levels at the rod, and ask your friend to move his finger, or a
white card, up and down until it is exactly in your line of sight.
Now ask your friend to tell you exactly where his finger or card
is and record this height. Let us suppose that it is 4 feet 6
inches above the ground. Now leave the level exactly where it
is, ask your friend to hold the rod upright at the second point,
and again sight along the water levels at the rod. Let us suppose
that his finger or card is now exactly 3 feet above the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference in level at the two points is 4 feet 6 inches
minus 3 feet or 1 foot 6 inches. That is, the second point is 1½
feet above the first point or the grade is 1.5 feet in 100, or 1.5
per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can now mark a third point 100 feet beyond the second
point, set up your level between the second point and third
point, place the rod at the second point, then at the third point,
and find their difference in level as above. If the third point
is 1 foot above the second, the total rise in the 200 feet is 2½
feet; if, however, it is 1 foot below the second, the rise is 1½
minus 1 or ½ foot in the 200 feet.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>MAGICAL EXPERIMENTS</h4>

<p class='c006'>Boys, you can perform many magic experiments with apparatus
made out of the glass tubes, rubber stoppers, and rubber
unions supplied with “Experimental Glass Blowing.” We outline
a number in the following pages. You can invent many
more for yourselves.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>MAGIC WITH FLAMES</h4>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 70. Magic lighting.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Light your alcohol lamp, blow it out, and bring a lighted match
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>down toward the wick from
above (Fig. 93). Does the
lamp light in a most magical
manner <b>before the
match touches the wick</b>?</p>

<p>FIG. 93<br>  <br>  MAGIC</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Repeat this with a kerosene
lamp and with a candle.
Do they light in the
same magical manner?</p>

<h4 class='c008'>The “why” of it</h4>

<p class='c006'>When the lamp is lighted,
the alcohol or kerosene
turns to a gas, and it is the
gas which burns; when the
candle is lighted, the wax turns to an oil, the oil turns to a gas,
and it is the gas which burns.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gas rises from the wick for a short time after the flame
is blown out, and it is this gas which lights when you bring the
match down toward the wick.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 71. Air used by flames.</h3>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 94<br>  <br>  THE CANDLES GO OUT AND THE WATER RISES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Drop melted candle wax on a tin can cover and attach the bottoms
of two candles to the cover (Fig. 94); use one candle about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>4 inches long and another about 3 inches, stand them upright
in a pan of water, light them, and invert a wide-mouthed bottle
over them. Does some air escape at first due to expansion, do
both candles go out, the taller one first, and does the water
rise until the bottle is about one-fifth full?</p>

<div  class='figright id001'>
<img src='images/fig_095.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 95<br>  <br>  THE CORK RISES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Cut a piece of candle
½ inch long, float
it on a flat cork or can
cover in the pan of
water, light it, and invert
a fresh empty
bottle over it (Fig. 95).
Is the result similar?</p>

<h4 class='c008'>The “why” of it</h4>

<p class='c006'>The water rises in
the bottle because ⅕ of the air is used up by the burning candle.
Air is ⅕ oxygen and ⅘ nitrogen. The oxygen unites with the
burning gas of the candle and produces water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) and
carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>); the nitrogen takes no part in the burning.</p>

<div  class='figleft id001'>
<img src='images/fig_096.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 96<br>  <br>  WATER FROM FLAME</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) condenses to water
on cooling and takes up very little space. The
carbon dioxide remains a gas and occupies
space, but this is offset by the volume of the
air which escaped at first. The result is that
the volume of gas at the end is about ⅕ less,
and the atmospheric pressure on the water in
the pan lifts water into the bottle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The candle goes out because it must have
oxygen to burn and the oxygen is used up.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 72. Water produced by fire.</h3>

<p class='c006'>It is certainly magic to produce water from
fire, but you can do it easily as follows:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Hold a clean, dry, cold tumbler over your alcohol lamp flame
(Fig. 96). Does water deposit in the form of mist on the inside
of the tumbler?</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 97<br>  <br>  ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Repeat with fresh tumblers with the flame of a kerosene lamp
and of a candle.
Are the results
similar?</p>

<p class='c007'>Direct the
blowpipe flame
into the end of a
piece of No. 2 or
4 tubing. Does
water deposit in
drops inside the
tube about 1 inch
above the end?</p>

<h4 class='c008'>The “why” of it</h4>

<p class='c006'>One of the chief constituents of alcohol, kerosene, and candle
wax is hydrogen (H), and when this burns in the oxygen (O)
of the air, it produces water (H<sub>2</sub>O). It is this water which condenses
on the cold glass.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>MAGIC WITH AIR</h4>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 73. Atmospheric pressure.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Arrange a No. 6 tube as in 1, Fig. 97, and suck air out at the
top. Does the water run uphill into your mouth?</p>

<p class='c007'>Hold your finger over the top and lift the tube out of the
pail (2). Does the water remain in the tube? Fill a bottle with
water to overflowing, insert a No. 2 tube into your one-hole
stopper, insert the stopper into the mouth of the bottle (3)
without admitting air below the stopper, and try to suck water
out of the bottle. Do you find that you cannot do so?</p>

<p>FIG. 98<br>  <br>  WATER DRIVEN UP TUBE BY ATMOSPHERE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Repeat (3) with the bottle half full of air
(4). Do you find that you can now suck part
of the water out of the bottle, and all of it
if you admit air?</p>

<h4 class='c008'>The “why” of it</h4>

<p class='c006'>The atmosphere which surrounds the earth
exerts a pressure of 15 pounds per square
inch on everything at the earth’s surface. It
exerts this pressure equally downward, sidewise,
and upward.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this atmospheric pressure on the
water in the pail (1) which lifts the water
into the tube when you decrease the pressure
on the water in the tube by sucking out
air and then water.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this pressure upward that supports
the water in 2.</p>

<p class='c007'>The water does not rise in 3 because the atmosphere cannot
exert pressure downward on the water in the bottle.</p>

<div  class='figright id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 99<br>  <br>  A FOUNTAIN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The rise of the water in 4
is due to another fact, namely,
that any gas expands when the
pressure on it is decreased.
When you suck air out of the
tube you decrease the pressure
on the water in the tube and
thereby on the air in the bottle;
the air then expands and lifts
the water into your mouth.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 74. Great pressure of air.</h3>

<p class='c006'>With the apparatus Fig. 98
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>hold your finger over the lower
end of the tube, suck as much
air as you can out of the tube,
pinch the coupling, and remove
your finger under water. Does
the atmosphere drive water up
the tube very rapidly and with
great force?</p>

<p class='c006'>With the apparatus Fig. 99
suck as much air as you can out

and open it under water. Does
the atmosphere lift the water into the
bottle and produce a beautiful fountain?</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 76. Magic tumbler.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Fill a tumbler with water, cover it
with a sheet of paper, hold the paper
on with your hand, invert the tumbler,
and remove your hand (Fig. 100).
Does the atmospheric pressure upward
support the paper and water?</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 77. Magic lift.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Fill a tumbler with water, press
your palm down on the top with
your fingers pointing downward
(Fig. 101), straighten your fingers
without admitting air to the tumbler,
and then lift your hand. Do
you lift the tumbler of water also?</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a partial vacuum between
your hand and the water, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>atmospheric pressure upward
and downward holds your hand
and the tumbler together.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 79. A poultry fountain.</h3>

<p class='c006'>To make the poultry fountain
(Fig. 103), fill a bottle
with water, hold your thumb
over the mouth, invert the
bottle over the pan of water,
and remove your thumb under
water. Does the atmospheric
pressure on the water
in the pan hold the water in
the bottle?</p>

<p class='c007'>Lift the bottle until the
mouth is a little above the
water in the pan. Does air
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>enter and water run out until the mouth is again covered with
water? This is what happens when the poultry, by drinking,
lower the water below the mouth of the bottle.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a poultry fountain the bottle is supported, as shown, with
its mouth under water but above the
bottom.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>Experiment 80. A drinking fountain.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The drinking fountain (Fig. 104) is similar in principle to
the poultry fountain of the last experiment. The water is held
in the large inverted bottle by the atmospheric pressure on the
water in the lower vessel. Air enters the bottle and water escapes
from it when the level of the water in the lower vessel falls below
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the mouth of the bottle. The water is cooled by the ice surrounding
the lower vessel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Make a drinking fountain of this kind as in Fig. 105, ask a
friend to hold it, remove the glass plug from the coupling, and
draw a glass of water. Do you observe that air bubbles enter the
inverted bottle and water flows from it only when the water level
in the half bottle falls below the mouth of the inverted bottle?</p>

<p class='c007'>Allow the water to flow
continuously. Is the water
level practically constant in
the half bottle until the upper
bottle is empty?</p>
